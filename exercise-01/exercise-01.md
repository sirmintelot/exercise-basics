# Exercise 01 - Function basics

## Aim

In this exercise, we learn how to write basic functions that can be tested.

## Exercise

Write a function that takes in a number of at least 0 and returns a grade as string.

There are multiple grades:

- 0 - 50: N
- 51 - 70: R
- 71 - 90: SR
- 91 - 100+: UR

# This function sounds quite like a dictionary function where typically a key is required to return a grade. 
# Given the fact that this key is given in a range
